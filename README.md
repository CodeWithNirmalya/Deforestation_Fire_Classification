# 🌲 Deforestation Fire Classification

This repository contains Week 1 work for the machine learning internship project focused on classifying deforestation-related fire occurrences using supervised learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify and predict whether a fire event is related to deforestation based on environmental and geographic features.

## ✅ Week 1 Tasks Completed

- ✅ Loaded and explored the dataset
- ✅ Preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoding if needed)
- ✅ Performed feature selection using:
  - SelectKBest with `f_classif` and `mutual_info_classif`
- ✅ Scaled features using `StandardScaler`
- ✅ Trained initial ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- ✅ Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy score
  - Classification report
  - Confusion matrix
